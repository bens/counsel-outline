* =counsel-outline=

This repository is derived from /jocap/'s package [[https://github.com/jocap/outline-ivy-mirror][outline-ivy-mirror]], which is a fork of /ekaschalk/'s excellent package [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/.spacemacs.d/blob/master/layers/personal/local/outline-ivy/outline-ivy.el][outline-ivy]]. I encountered some bugs in the jocap fork which hadn't been touched in seven years, and decided to rename it to better fit with other similar packages which use =ivy=.

* Installation

The easiest way to install is through [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package counsel-outline
  :ensure nil
  :load-path "packages/counsel-outline"
  :bind (:map outline-minor-mode-map
              ("C-c o" . counsel-outline-jump)))
#+END_SRC

Above is my personal configuration. Adjust it to suit your needs.
