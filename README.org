* =outline-ivy=

This repository serves as a mirror of /ekaschalk/'s excellent package [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/.spacemacs.d/blob/master/layers/personal/local/outline-ivy/outline-ivy.el][outline-ivy]].
The mirror was created due to the lack of any official, standalone repository
for =outline-ivy=.

Any further commits will probably contain my own, personal changes. Also there
is no guarantee that this repository is kept up-to-date with /ekaschalk/'s
version.

** Installation

The easiest way to install is through [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package outline-ivy
  :ensure nil
  :load-path "packages/outline-ivy"
  :bind (:map outline-minor-mode-map
              ("s-o" . oi-jump)))
#+END_SRC

Above is my personal configuration. Adjust it to suit your needs.

** License

Like /ekaschalk/'s original code, it is licensed under the MIT license. (See
=LICENSE= file.)
